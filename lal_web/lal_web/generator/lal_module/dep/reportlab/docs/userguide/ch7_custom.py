Flowables are intended to be an open standard for creating
reusable report content, and you can easily create your
own objects.  We hope that over time we will build up
a library of contributions, giving reportlab users a
rich selection of charts, graphics and other "report
widgets" they can use in their own reports. This section
shows you how to create your own flowables.""")

Recall the $hand$ function from the $pdfgen$ section of this user guide which

To embed this or any other drawing in a Platypus flowable we must define a
subclass of $Flowable$
with at least a $wrap$ method and a $draw$ method.

The $wrap$ method must provide the size of the drawing -- it is used by
the Platypus mainloop to decide whether this element fits in the space remaining
on the current frame.  The $draw$ method performs the drawing of the object after
the Platypus mainloop has translated the $(0,0)$ origin to an appropriate location
in an appropriate frame.
