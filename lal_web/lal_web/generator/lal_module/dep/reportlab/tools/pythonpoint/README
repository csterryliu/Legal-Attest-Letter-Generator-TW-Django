PythonPoint is a utility for generating PDF slides from 
a simple XML format - "PythonPoint Markup Language".

This is early days.  It lets you produce quite sophisticated
output, but the DTD will undoubtedly evolve and change.
However, I want people to be able to use it this summer so am
releasing now.

It is part of the ReportLab distribution; if you have managed
to run the ReportLab tests, and have installed the Python
Imaging Library, usage should be straightforward.  PIL is not 
required to make slides, but the demo will have a few blanks if 
you omit it.

To use, cd to the pythonpoint directory and execute:
	pythonpoint.py pythonpoint.xml
This will create pythonpoint.pdf, which is your manual.

You can also try 'monterey.xml', which is a talk I gave
at the O'Reilly Open Source conference in Monterey
in summer 1999.

We have issues to resolve over module load paths;
the easiest solution for now is to put the PythonPoint
directory on your path; work in a new directory;
and explicitly include the paths to any custom shapes,
and style sheets you use.
