The three scripts odyssey.py, dodyssey.py and fodyssey.py all take the file odyssey.txt
and produce PDF documents. The included odyssey.txt is short; a longer and more testing version
can be found at ftp://ftp.reportlab.com/odyssey.full.zip.

disc("""Simple formatting is shown by the odyssey.py script. It runs quite fast,
but all it does is gather the text and force it onto the canvas pages. It does no paragraph
manipulation at all so you get to see the XML &lt; &amp; &gt; tags.

disc("""The scripts fodyssey.py and dodyssey.py handle paragraph formatting so you get
to see colour changes etc. Both scripts
use the document template class and the dodyssey.py script shows the ability to do dual column
layout and uses multiple page templates.

The Python script, gfe.py, in $reportlab/demos/gadflypaper$ uses an inline style of

everything in the PDF document was produced by the script which is why this is an inline style

heading2("""Pythonpoint""")

until it is a really useful script. It takes an input file containing an XML markup
and uses an xmllib style parser to map the tags into PDF slides. When run in its own directory
pythonpoint.py takes as a default input the file pythonpoint.xml and produces pythonpoint.pdf
which is documentation for Pythonpoint! You can also see it in action with an older paper

disc("""
Not only is pythonpoint self documenting, but it also demonstrates reportlab and PDF. It uses
many features of reportlab (document templates, tables etc).
Exotic features of PDF such as fadeins and bookmarks are also shown to good effect. The use of
an XML document can be contrasted with the <i>inline</i> style of the gadflypaper demo; the
content is completely separate from the formatting
