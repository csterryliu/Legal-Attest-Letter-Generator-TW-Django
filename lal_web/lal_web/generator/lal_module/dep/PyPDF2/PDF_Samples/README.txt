PDF Sample Folder
-----------------

PDF files are generated by a large variety of sources
for many different purposes. One of the goals of PyPDF2
is to be able to read/write any PDF instance that Adobe
can.

This is a catalog of various PDF files. The
files may not have worked with PyPDF2 but do now, they
may be complicated or unconventional files, or they may
just be good for testing. The purpose is to insure that
when changes to PyPDF2 are made, we keep them in mind.

If you have confidential PDFs that don't work with
PyPDF2, feel free to still e-mail them for debugging -
we won't add PDFs without expressed permission.

(This folder is available through GitHub only)


Feel free to add any type of PDF file or sample code, 
either by

	1) sending it via email to PyPDF2@phaseit.net
