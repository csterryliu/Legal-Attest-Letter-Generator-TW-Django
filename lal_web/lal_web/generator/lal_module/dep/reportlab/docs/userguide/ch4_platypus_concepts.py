heading1("PLATYPUS - Page Layout and Typography Using Scripts")

heading2("Design Goals")

disc("""
Platypus stands for &quot;Page Layout and Typography Using Scripts&quot;.  It is a high
level page layout library which lets you programmatically create complex
documents with a minimum of effort.
""")



disc("""
The design of Platypus seeks to separate "high level" layout decisions
from the document content as much as possible.  Thus, for example, paragraphs
are constructed using paragraph styles and pages are constructed
using page templates with the intention that hundreds of
documents with thousands of pages can be reformatted to different
style specifications with the modifications of a few lines in a single
shared file which contains the paragraph styles and page layout specifications.
""")


disc("""
The overall design of Platypus can be thought of has having
several layers, top down, these are""")

disc("<b>$DocTemplates$</b> the outermost container for the document;")

disc("<b>$PageTemplates$</b> specifications for layouts of pages of various kinds;")

disc("<b>$Frames$</b> specifications of regions in pages that can contain flowing text or graphics.")

disc("""<b>$Flowables$</b> text or graphic elements that should be "flowed
   into the document (i.e. things like images, paragraphs and tables, but not things
   like page footers or fixed page graphics).""")

disc("""<b>$pdfgen.Canvas$</b> the lowest level which ultimately receives the painting of the
   document from the other layers.""")

illust(examples.doctemplateillustration, "Illustration of DocTemplate structure")

disc("""
 The illustration above graphically illustrates the concepts of $DocTemplates$,
 $PageTemplates$ and $Flowables$.  It is deceptive, however, because each
 of the $PageTemplates$ actually may specify the format for any number of pages
 (not just one as might be inferred from the diagram).
""")

disc("""
$DocTemplates$ contain one or more $PageTemplates$ each of which contain one or more
$Frames$. $Flowables$ are things which can be <i>flowed</i> into a $Frame$ e.g.
a $Paragraph$ or a $Table$.
""")

disc("""
To use platypus you create a document from a $DocTemplate$ class and pass
a list of $Flowable$s to its $build$ method. The document
$build$ method knows how to process the list of flowables
into something reasonable.
""")

disc("""
Internally the $DocTemplate$ class implements page layout and formatting
using various events. Each of the events has a corresponding handler method
called $handle_XXX$ where $XXX$ is the event name. A typical event is
$frameBegin$ which occurs when the machinery begins to use a frame for the
first time.
""")

disc("""
A Platypus story consists of a sequence of basic elements called $Flowables$
and these elements drive the data driven Platypus formatting engine.
To modify the behavior of the engine
a special kind of flowable, $ActionFlowables$, tell the layout engine to,
for example, skip to the next
column or change to another $PageTemplate$.

a very simple "hello world" example for Platypus.""")

disc("""We define the fixed features of the first page of the document
with the function above.""")

eg(examples.platypusnextpage)

disc("""Since we want pages after the first to look different from the
first we define an alternate layout for the fixed features
of the other pages.  Note that the two functions above use
the $pdfgen$ level canvas operations to paint the annotations for
the pages.
""")

eg(examples.platypusgo)

disc("""
Finally, we create a story and build the document.
Note that we are using a "canned" document template here which
comes pre-built with page templates.  We are also using a pre-built
paragraph style.  We are only using two types of flowables here
-- $Spacers$ and $Paragraphs$.  The first $Spacer$ ensures that the
Paragraphs skip past the title string.

disc("""

$docs/userguide/examples.py$ (from the ReportLab $docs$ distribution)

$Flowables$ are things which can be drawn and which have $wrap$, $draw$ and perhaps $split$ methods.
$Flowable$ is an abstract base class for things to be drawn and an instance knows its size

system when the $Flowable.draw$ method is called). To get an instance use $f=Flowable()$.

Clever flowables should split themselves and return a list of flowables. It is up to
the client code to ensure that repeated attempts to split are avoided.
If the space is sufficient the split method should return [self].
Otherwise
the flowable should rearrange itself and return a list $[f0,...]$ of flowables
