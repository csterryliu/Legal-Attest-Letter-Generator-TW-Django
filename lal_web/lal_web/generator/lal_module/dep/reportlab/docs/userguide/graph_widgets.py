heading3("Shapes vs. Widgets")

disc("""Up until now, Drawings have been 'pure data'. There is no code in them
       to actually do anything, except assist the programmer in checking and
       inspecting the drawing. In fact, that's the cornerstone of the whole
       concept and is what lets us achieve portability - a renderer only
       needs to implement the primitive shapes.""")

disc("""We want to build reusable graphic objects, including a powerful chart
       library. To do this we need to reuse more tangible things than
       rectangles and circles. We should be able to write objects for other
       to reuse - arrows, gears, text boxes, UML diagram nodes, even fully
       fledged charts.""")

disc("""
The Widget standard is a standard built on top of the shapes module.
Anyone can write new widgets, and we can build up libraries of them.
Widgets support the $getProperties()$ and $setProperties()$ methods,
so you can inspect and modify as well as document them in a uniform
way.

       example of itself in a 200x100 rectangle. This is the cornerstone of
       the automatic documentation tools. The $demo()$ method should also have
       a well written docstring, since that is printed too!""")

disc("""Widgets run contrary to the idea that a drawing is just a bundle of
       shapes; surely they have their own code? The way they work is that a
       widget can convert itself to a group of primitive shapes. If some of
       its components are themselves widgets, they will get converted too.
       This happens automatically during rendering; the renderer will not see
       your chart widget, but just a collection of rectangles, lines and
       strings. You can also explicitly 'flatten out' a drawing, causing all
       widgets to be converted to primitives.""")

One thing which seems strange about the above code is that we did not
set the size or position when we made the face.
This is a necessary trade-off to allow a uniform interface for
constructing widgets and documenting them - they cannot require
arguments in their $__init__()$ method.
Instead, they are generally designed to fit in a 200 x 100
window, and you move or resize them by setting properties such as
x, y, width and so on after creation.

disc("""
In addition, a widget always provides a $demo()$ method.
Simple ones like this always do something sensible before setting
properties, but more complex ones like a chart would not have any
data to plot.
The documentation tool calls $demo()$ so that your fancy new chart
class can create a drawing showing what it can do.

       select non-overlapping properties, initialize every property on
       $__init__$ and construct everything when $draw()$ is called. You can
       instead have $__setattr__$ hooks and have things updated when certain
       attributes are set. Consider a pie chart. If you want to expose the
       individual wedges, you might write code like this:""")

eg("""
from reportlab.graphics.charts import piecharts

pc.data = [10,30,50,25]
pc.slices[7].strokeWidth = 5

#removed 'pc.backColor = yellow' from above code example

disc("""The last line is problematic as we have only created four wedges - in
       fact we might not have created them yet. Does $pc.wedges[7]$ raise an
       error? Is it a prescription for what should happen if a seventh wedge
       is defined, used to override the default settings? We dump this
       problem squarely on the widget author for now, and recommend that you
       get a simple one working before exposing 'child objects' whose
       existence depends on other properties' values :-)""")

disc("""We also discussed rules by which parent widgets could pass properties
       to their children. There seems to be a general desire for a global way
       to say that 'all wedges get their lineWidth from the lineWidth of
       their parent' without a lot of repetitive coding. We do not have a
       universal solution, so again leave that to widget authors. We hope
       people will experiment with push-down, pull-down and pattern-matching
       approaches and come up with something nice. In the meantime, we
       certainly can write monolithic chart widgets which work like the ones
