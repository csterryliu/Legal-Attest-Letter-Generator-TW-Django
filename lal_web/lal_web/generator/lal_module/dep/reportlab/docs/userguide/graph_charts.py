disc("Here are some of the design goals: ")

disc("<i>Make simple top-level use really simple </i>")
disc("""<para lindent="+36">It should be possible to create a simple chart with minimum lines of
       code, yet have it 'do the right things' with sensible automatic
       settings. The pie chart snippets above do this. If a real chart has
       many subcomponents, you still should not need to interact with them
       unless you want to customize what they do.</para>""")

disc("<i>Allow precise positioning </i>")
disc("""<para lindent="+36">An absolute requirement in publishing and graphic design is to control
       the placing and style of every element. We will try to have properties
       that specify things in fixed sizes and proportions of the drawing,
       rather than having automatic resizing. Thus, the 'inner plot
       rectangle' will not magically change when you make the font size of
       the y labels bigger, even if this means your labels can spill out of
       the left edge of the chart rectangle. It is your job to preview the
       chart and choose sizes and spaces which will work.</para>""")

disc("""<para lindent="+36">Some things do need to be automatic. For example, if you want to fit N
       bars into a 200 point space and don't know N in advance, we specify
       bar separation as a percentage of the width of a bar rather than a
       point size, and let the chart work it out. This is still deterministic
       and controllable.</para>""")

disc("<i>Control child elements individually or as a group</i>")
disc("""<para lindent="+36">We use smart collection classes that let you customize a group of
       things, or just one of them. For example you can do this in our
       experimental pie chart:</para>""")

disc("""<para lindent="+36">It would be wrong from a statistical viewpoint to let you directly
       adjust the angle of one of the pie wedges in the above example, since

       functionality, but in general properties will be orthogonal.</para>""")

disc("""A chart or plot is an object which is placed on a drawing; it is not
       itself a drawing. You can thus control where it goes, put several on
       the same drawing, or add annotations.""")

disc("""Charts have two axes; axes may be Value or Category axes. Axes in turn
       have a Labels property which lets you configure all text labels or
       each one individually. Most of the configuration details which vary
       from chart to chart relate to axis properties, or axis labels.""")

disc("""Objects expose properties through the interfaces discussed in the
       previous section; these are all optional and are there to let the end
       user configure the appearance. Things which must be set for a chart to
       work, and essential communication between a chart and its components,
       are handled through methods.""")

disc("""You can subclass any chart component and use your replacement instead
       of the original provided you implement the essential methods and
       properties.""")


heading2("Labels")

A label is a string of text attached to some chart element.
They are used on axes, for titles or alongside axes, or attached
to individual data points.
Labels may contain newline characters, but only one font.
""")

disc("""The text and 'origin' of a label are typically set by its parent
       object. They are accessed by methods rather than properties. Thus, the
       X axis decides the 'reference point' for each tickmark label and the

A Category Axis doesn't really have a scale; it just divides itself

itself.
This is easy for a category axis - it just counts the number of
data points in one of the data series. The $reversed$ attribute (if 1)
indicates that the categories should be reversed.
When the drawing is drawn, the axis can provide some help to the
chart with its $scale()$ method, which tells the chart where
a given category begins and ends on the page.

##Property Value
##data This should be a "list of lists of numbers" or "list of tuples of numbers". If you have just one series, write it as
##data = [(10,20,30,42),]
##
##x, y, width, height These define the inner 'plot rectangle'. We highlighted this with a yellow border above. Note that it is your job to place the chart on the drawing in a way which leaves room for all the axis labels and tickmarks. We specify this 'inner rectangle' because it makes it very easy to lay out multiple charts in a consistent manner.
##strokeColor Defaults to None. This will draw a border around the plot rectangle, which may be useful in debugging. Axes will overwrite this.
##fillColor Defaults to None. This will fill the plot rectangle with a solid color. (Note that we could implement dashArray etc. as for any other solid shape)
##barLabelFormat This is a format string or function used for displaying labels above each bar. We're working on ways to position these labels so that they work for positive and negative bars.
##useAbsolute Defaults to 0. If 1, the three properties below are absolute values in points (which means you can make a chart where the bars stick out from the plot rectangle); if 0, they are relative quantities and indicate the proportional widths of the elements involved.
##barWidth As it says. Defaults to 10.
##groupSpacing Defaults to 5. This is the space between each group of bars. If you have only one series, use groupSpacing and not barSpacing to split them up. Half of the groupSpacing is used before the first bar in the chart, and another half at the end.
##barSpacing Defaults to 0. This is the spacing between bars in each group. If you wanted a little gap between green and red bars in the example above, you would make this non-zero.
##barLabelFormat Defaults to None. As with the YValueAxis, if you supply a function or format string then labels will be drawn next to each bar showing the numeric value.
##barLabels A collection of labels used to format all bar labels. Since this is a two-dimensional array, you may explicitly format the third label of the second series using this syntax:
##    chart.barLabels[(1,2)].fontSize = 12
##
##valueAxis The value axis, which may be formatted as described previously
##categoryAxis The categoryAxis, which may be formatted as described previously
##title, subTitle Not implemented yet. These would be label-like objects whose text could be set directly and which would appear in sensible locations. For now, you can just place extra strings on the drawing.

If the sideLabels attribute is set to true, then the labels of 
the slices are placed in two columns, one on either side of the 
pie and the start angle of the pie will be set automatically.
The anchor of the right hand column is set to 'start' and the 
anchor of the left hand column is set to 'end'.
The distance from the edge of the pie from the edge of either 
column is decided by the sideLabelsOffset attribute, which is 
a fraction of the width of the pie.
If xradius is changed, the pie can overlap the labels, and so 
we advise leaving xradius as None.
There is an example below.

Various preliminary legend classes can be found but need a

Legends are the natural place to specify the colors and line

a $legend$ attribute which is invisible.
One would then do the following to specify colors:

heading3("Remaining Issues")

disc("""
There are several issues that are <i>almost</i> solved, but for which
is is a bit too early to start making them really public.
Nevertheless, here is a list of things that are under way:
""")

bullet("""
Color specification - right now the chart has an undocumented property
$defaultColors$, which provides a list of colors to cycle through,
such that each data series gets its own color.
Right now, if you introduce a legend, you need to make sure it shares
the same list of colors.
Most likely, this will be replaced with a scheme to specify a kind
of legend containing attributes with different values for each data
series.
This legend can then also be shared by several charts, but need not
be visible itself.
""")

bullet("""
Additional chart types - when the current design will have become
more stable, we expect to add variants of bar charts to deal with
percentile bars as well as the side-by-side variant seen here.
""")


heading3("Outlook")

disc("""
It will take some time to deal with the full range of chart types.
We expect to finalize bars and pies first and to produce trial
implementations of more general plots, thereafter.
""")


heading3("X-Y Plots")

disc("""
Most other plots involve two value axes and directly plotting
x-y data in some form.
The series can be plotted as lines, marker symbols, both, or
custom graphics such as open-high-low-close graphics.
All share the concepts of scaling and axis/title formatting.
At a certain point, a routine will loop over the data series and
'do something' with the data points at given x-y locations.
Given a basic line plot, it should be very easy to derive a
custom chart type just by overriding a single method - say,
$drawSeries()$.
""")


heading3("Marker customisation and custom shapes")

disc("""
Well known plotting packages such as excel, Mathematica and Excel
offer ranges of marker types to add to charts.
We can do better - you can write any kind of chart widget you
want and just tell the chart to use it as an example.
""")


heading4("Combination plots")

disc("""
Combining multiple plot types is really easy.
You can just draw several charts (bar, line or whatever) in
the same rectangle, suppressing axes as needed.
So a chart could correlate a line with Scottish typhoid cases
over a 15 year period on the left axis with a set of bars showing
inflation rates on the right axis.
If anyone can remind us where this example came from we'll
attribute it, and happily show the well-known graph as an
example.

heading3("Interactive editors")

disc("""
One principle of the Graphics package is to make all 'interesting'
properties of its graphic components accessible and changeable by
setting apropriate values of corresponding public attributes.
This makes it very tempting to build a tool like a GUI editor that
that helps you with doing that interactively.
""")

disc("""
ReportLab has built such a tool using the Tkinter toolkit that
loads pure Python code describing a drawing and records your
property editing operations.
This "change history" is then used to create code for a subclass
of that chart, say, that can be saved and used instantly just
like any other chart or as a new starting point for another
interactive editing session.
