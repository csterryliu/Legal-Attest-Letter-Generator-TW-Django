heading2("About this document")
disc("""This document is an introduction to the ReportLab PDF library.
Some previous programming experience
is presumed and familiarity with the Python Programming language is
recommended.  If you are new to Python, we tell you in the next section
where to go for orientation.
""")

disc("""
This manual does not cover 100% of the features, but should explain all
the main concepts and help you get started, and point you at other
learning resources. 
After working your way through this, you should be ready to begin
writing programs to produce sophisticated reports.

bullet("What is Python?")
bullet("How do I get everything set up and running?")

todo("""

heading2("What is the ReportLab PDF Library?")
disc("""This is a software library that lets you directly
create documents in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) using
the Python programming language.   It also creates charts and data graphics
in various bitmap and vector formats as well as PDF.""")

disc("""PDF is the global standard for electronic documents. It
supports high-quality printing yet is totally portable across
platforms, thanks to the freely available Acrobat Reader.  Any
application which previously generated hard copy reports or driving a printer
can benefit from making PDF documents instead; these can be archived,
emailed, placed on the web, or printed out the old-fashioned way.
However, the PDF file format is a complex
indexed binary format which is impossible to type directly.
The PDF format specification is more than 600 pages long and
PDF files must provide precise byte offsets -- a single extra
character placed anywhere in a valid PDF document can render it
invalid.  This makes it harder to generate than HTML.""")

disc("""Most of the world's PDF documents have been produced
by Adobe's Acrobat tools, or rivals such as JAWS PDF Creator, which act
as 'print drivers'.  Anyone wanting to automate PDF production would
typically use a product like Quark, Word or Framemaker running in a loop
with macros or plugins, connected to Acrobat. Pipelines of several
languages and products can be slow and somewhat unwieldy.
""")


disc("""The ReportLab library directly creates PDF based on
your graphics commands.  There are no intervening steps.  Your applications
can generate reports extremely fast - sometimes orders
of magnitude faster than traditional report-writing
tools.   This approach is shared by several other libraries - PDFlib for C,
iText for Java, iTextSharp for .NET and others.  However, The ReportLab library
differs in that it can work at much higher levels, with a full featured engine
for laying out documents complete with tables and charts.  """)


disc("""In addition, because you are writing a program
in a powerful general purpose language, there are no
restrictions at all on where you get your data from,
how you transform it, and the kind of output
you can create.  And you can reuse code across
whole families of reports.""")

disc("""The ReportLab library is expected to be useful
in at least the following contexts:""")
bullet("Dynamic PDF generation on the web")
bullet("High-volume corporate reporting and database publishing")
bullet("""An embeddable print engine for other applications, including
a 'report language' so that users can customize their own reports. <i>
This is particularly relevant to cross-platform apps which cannot
rely on a consistent printing or previewing API on each operating
system</i>.""")
bullet("""A 'build system' for complex documents with charts, tables
and text such as management accounts, statistical reports and
scientific papers """)
bullet("""Going from XML to PDF in one step""")


heading2("ReportLab's commercial software")
disc("""
The ReportLab library forms the foundation of our commercial solution for
PDF generation, Report Markup Language (RML).  This is available for evaluation
on our web site with full documentation.   We believe that RML is the fastest
and easiest way to develop rich PDF workflows.  You work in a markup language
at a similar level to HTML, using your favorite templating system to populate
an RML document; then call our rml2pdf API function to generate a PDF.  It's
what ReportLab staff use to build all of the solutions you can see on reportlab.com.
Key differences:
""")
bullet("""Fully documented with two manuals, a formal specification (the DTD) and extensive self-documenting tests.  (By contrast, we try to make sure the open source documentation isn't wrong, but we don't always keep up with the code)""")
bullet("""Work in high-level markup rather than constructing graphs of Python objects """)
bullet("""Requires no Python expertise - your colleagues may thank you after you've left!'""")
bullet("""Support for vector graphics and inclusion of other PDF documents""")
bullet("""Many more useful features expressed with a single tag, which would need a lot
of coding in the open source package""")
bullet("""Commercial support is included""")


disc("""
We ask open source developers to consider trying out RML where it is appropriate.
You can register on our site and try out a copy before buying.
The costs are reasonable and linked to the volume of the project, and the revenue
helps us spend more time developing this software.""")


heading2("What is Python?")
disc("""
Python is an <i>interpreted, interactive, object-oriented</i> programming language. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl,
Scheme or Java.
""")

disc("""
Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level
dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to
various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++.
Python is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.
""")


disc("""
Python is as old as Java and has been growing steadily in popularity for years; since our
library first came out it has entered the mainstream.  Many ReportLab library users are
already Python devotees, but if you are not, we feel that the language is an excellent
choice for document-generation apps because of its expressiveness and ability to get
data from anywhere.

Python is copyrighted but <b>freely usable and distributable, even for commercial use</b>.
