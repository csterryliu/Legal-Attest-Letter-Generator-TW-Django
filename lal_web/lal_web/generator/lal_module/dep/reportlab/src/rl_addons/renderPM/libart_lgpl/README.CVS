Welcome to the libart source tree!

This code is being developed in a "free software for sale"
model. Thus, it's available under a free software license (LGPL for
this module), but I'm also requesting that for all changes to the code
the copyright gets assigned back to me.

So if you want to contribute, please do, but contact me about getting
the copyright assigned. Otherwise, I will have to back your changes
out.

Thanks!
