Sphinx is being used for the automated API references.  We have
always been able to make our own documents in PDF, without using other
peoples' libraries, and don't want to back away from this. So, the main
User Guide will remain in PDF format for now.  However, programmers need
API refs online, and we want to learn Sphinx (and use rst2pdf) in due
course.
