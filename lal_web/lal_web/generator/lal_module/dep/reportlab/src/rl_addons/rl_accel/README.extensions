This directory contains all of ReportLab's extensions.

The file __BUILD.dsw is suitable for VC++ 6.0; th dsp files are 
for individual projects. At present these are

	_rl_accel.dsp (.c)
	pyHnj.dsp

for unix the Setup.in and generic Makefile.pre.in are included.
You need to do

	make -f Makefile.pre.in boot
	make

then you should have some shared libraries.

Alternatively you can use the distutils setup.py file
eg
	setup.py build or setup.py install
